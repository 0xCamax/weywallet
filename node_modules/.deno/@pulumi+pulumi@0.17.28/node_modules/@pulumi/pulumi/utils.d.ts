 * synchronous in a backward compatible fashion.  Specifically, because the function now returns a
 * `Promise<T> & T` all properties on it will be available for sync consumers, while async consumers
 * can still use `await` on it or call `.then(...)` on it.
 *
 * This is an advanced compat function for libraries and should not generally be used by normal
 * Pulumi application.
